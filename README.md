Predicting geohelminths infections prevalence

<br>

### Notes

Approaches:

In every case outlined below, the model will be a type of binomial geo-statistical model, an inherently hierarchical/mixed model.  The random effect
term is a spatial structure - a stationary and isotropic zero-mean Gaussian process, its approximation depends on location co&ouml;rdinates.

1. Initially build separate models for a few countries.  Inefficient, but insightful.  In terms of splitting data sets into training & testing sets, if a
   * Country has approximately longitudinal data, split the data temporally.
   * Country's entire data set is due to single year, or predominantly a single year's data, split spatially.
  

2. Next, combine the data sets of the countries, and split into training & testing sets spatio-temporally.
